      <p>
        My name is Hector Delgado and I am currently on an ongoing journey to
        learn and perfect my skills as a full stack developer. I come from a
        customer service background, currently working for LinkedIn, but Ive
        recently decided to switch gears and help people in a different way. As
        a full stack developer, Ive discovered the joy of creating projects
        that others can view and use. I cant imagine the feeling you get when
        you finally see something youve built come to life and positively
        impact others. Im excited to continue learning and growing in this
        field, and I cant wait to see where this journey takes me!
